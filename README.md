# ARCADE

The Advanced Research Collaboration and Application Development Environment (ARCADE) is a collaboration project between the [ASTRIA Research Group](https://sites.utexas.edu/moriba/) at the University of Texas at Austin, the IBM Space Tech team, and other partners. The goal of this repository is to provide a unified and coherent API for accessing, analyzing, and extending a diverse set of derived data points concerning an anthropogenic space object (ASO). Note: this repository currently represents a small proof of concept and is in a very alpha state of development, so APIs (internal and external) may change greatly.
